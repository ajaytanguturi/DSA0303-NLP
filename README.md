1. Write program demonstrates how to use regular expressions in Python to match and search for
patterns in text.
2. Implement a basic finite state automaton that recognizes a specific language or pattern. In this
example, we'll create a simple automaton to match strings ending with &#39;ab&#39; using python.
3. Write program demonstrates how to perform morphological analysis using the NLTK library in
Python.
4. Implement a finite-state machine for morphological parsing. In this example, we&#39;ll create a
simple machine to generate plural forms of English nouns using python.
5. Use the Porter Stemmer algorithm to perform word stemming on a list of words using python
libraries.

Document Frequency) for document ranking using python.
22. Create a python program that performs syntax-driven semantic analysis by extracting noun
phrases and their meanings from a sentence.
23. Create a python program that performs reference resolution within a text.
24. Develop a python program that evaluates the coherence of a given text.
